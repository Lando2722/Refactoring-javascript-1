# Password Generator

1. I created a random password generator using javascript. The page itself is very simple. We were given starter code with the html
and css completed. For this exercise I used variables in javascript to create random generated sequences.

When the user visits the page, they will click generate password. From there they will be asked series of prompts. Included is the number
of characters and what type of characters the user wants to use. 

After the user finishes the questions prompted. They will be given a random generated password. This was a very direct assignment. I would add more features to the page using HTML and CSS in the future.
